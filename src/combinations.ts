  // Algorithm description:
  // To get k-combinations of a set, we want to join each element
  // with all (k-1)-combinations of the other elements. The set of
  // these k-sized sets would be the desired result. However, as we
  // represent sets with lists, we need to take duplicates into
  // account. To avoid producing duplicates and also unnecessary
  // computing, we use the following approach: each element i
  // divides the list into three: the preceding elements, the
  // current element i, and the subsequent elements. For the first
  // element, the list of preceding elements is empty. For element i,
  // we compute the (k-1)-computations of the subsequent elements,
  // join each with the element i, and store the joined to the set of
  // computed k-combinations. We do not need to take the preceding
  // elements into account, because they have already been the i:th
  // element so they are already computed and stored. When the length
  // of the subsequent list drops below (k-1), we cannot find any
  // (k-1)-combs, hence the upper limit for the iteration:
  const combs: any[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < set.length - k + 1; i++) {
    // head is a list that includes only our current element.
    const head = set.slice(i, i + 1);
    // We take smaller combinations from the subsequent elements
    const tailCombs = kCombinations(set.slice(i + 1), k - 1);
    // For each (k-1)-combination we join it with the current
    // and store it to the set of k-combinations.
    for (let j = 0; j < tailCombs.length; j++) {
      combs.push(head.concat(tailCombs[j]));
    }
